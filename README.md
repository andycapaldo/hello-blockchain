# 👋 Hello Blockchain

A simple DeFi wallet app that says... well, hello blockchain.

This lightweight dApp allows users to connect their wallet and view their ERC-20 token balances by entering a contract address. It's a beginner-friendly exploration of DeFi tooling, wallet integration, and token querying on the Ethereum network.

## 🧠 What It Does

- 🔌 Connect your wallet via **RainbowKit + Wagmi**
- ✍️ Paste any **ERC-20 token contract address**
- 💰 See your **balance** of that token in your connected wallet
- 🧼 Clean, no-frills UI to focus on function

---

## 🔧 Built With

- **React** – UI framework
- **Next.js** - React framework
- **RainbowKit** – Wallet connector
- **Wagmi** – Ethereum hooks & account state
- **Ethers.js** – Contract interaction and blockchain querying

---

## 📚 Why I Built It

This was a quick project to:
- Explore core Ethereum dev tools
- Learn how to interact with smart contracts from the frontend
- Start building crypto-native apps as I dive deeper into Web3

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Maybe)

- Validate token contract addresses
- Add support for token name/symbol display
- Display balances for multiple tokens at once
- Support networks beyond EVM-compatible ones
